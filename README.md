**Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns:** In this project, we predict the number of bikes a bike sharing company needs for daily bike rental ridership. This prediction helps to prevent situation of having unused bike and also situation of lacking bikes when riders need it.

**Dog Breed Classifier:** In this project, we detect dog and human from given datasets. If dog is detected, its breed is predicted. If human is detected, then dog breed which resembles to that human most, is predicted. We create CNN to classify dogs from scratch and using transfer learning.
